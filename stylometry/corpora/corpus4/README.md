In the case statements, 1st-, and 2nd-recension _dicta_ from Gratian's _Decretum_, there are 747 occurrences of 79 unique words ending in -_que_. (This does not count 423 occurrences of the word '_que_' itself.) Of those, 498 are occurrences of 19 unique words from Schinke's 54-word pass list, while 249 occurrences of 60 unique words are not. It is from these 249 words that, according to Schinke, the -_que_ ending should be detached as an enclitic.

However, the 249 words include 72 occurrences of 17 unique words ending with the adverbial enclitics –_cumque_ or -_cunque_, from which the -_que_ ending should not be detached. The 249 words also include a further 149 occurrences of 21 unique false positives:

+ _cumque_,
+ _eque_ (_aeque_),
+ _namque_,
+ _pleraque_, _plerique_, _plerisque_, _plerumque_,
+ _quinque_,
+ _unamquamque_, _unaqueque_, _unicuique_, _uniuscuiusque_, _unumquemque_, _unusquisque_, 
+ _usquequaque_,
+ _utramque_, _utraque_, _utrique_, _utrisque_, _utriusque_, _utrumque_.

This leaves only 28 occurrences of 22 unique words from which the –_que_ ending should actually be detached as an enclitic.

False positives over-represent the frequency of occurrence of the ‘-_que_’ enclitic as a conjunction by an order of magnitude. Including all false positives makes '_xque_' the 37th most frequent word in the sample, while excluding them makes it the 376th most frequent word. There are 55 occurrences of the word ‘_namque_’, the most frequently occurring false positive. Detaching the ‘-_que_’ ending from ‘_namque_’ overstates the frequency the frequency of ‘_nam_’, making what is actually the 480th most frequent word appear to be the 130th, while making ‘_namque_’, which is actually the 176th most frequent word in the samples when false positives are excluded, disappear from the list altogether.
