In the case statements, 1st-, and 2nd-recension dicta from Gratian's Decretum, there are 615 occurrences of 74 unique words ending in -que. (This does not count 339 occurrences of the word 'que'.) Of those, 393 are occurrences of 19 unique words from Schinke's 54-word pass list, while 222 occurrences of 55 unique words are not. It is from these 222 words that, according to Schinke, the -que ending should be detached as an enclitic.

However, the 222 words include 64 occurrences of 16 unique words ending with the adverbial enclitic -cu[mn]que, from which the -que ending should not be detached. The 222 words also includes a further 135 occurrences of 21 unique false positives:

cumque,
eque (aeque),
namque,
pleraque, plerique, plerisque, plerumque, (forms of plerusque)
quinque,
unamquamque, unaqueque, unicuique, uniuscuiusque, unumquemque, unusquisque, (forms of unusquisque)
usquequaque,
utramque, utraque, utrique, utrisque, utriusque, utrumque (forms of uterque)

This leaves only 23 occurrences of 18 unique words from which the -que ending should actually be detached as an enclitic.

False positives overrepresent the frequency of occurrence of the '-que' enclitic as a conjunction by an order of magnitude. Including all false positives makes 'xque' the 39th most frequent word in the sample, while excluding them makes it the 410th most frequent word. There are 47 occurrences of the word 'namque', the most frequently occurring false positive, and the 202nd most frequent word in the sample when false positives are excluded. Detaching the '-que' ending from 'namque' results in 'nam' jumping from 509th most frequent word in the sample to being the 137th, while 'namque' itself disappears altogether.
