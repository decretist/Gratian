In the case statements, 1st-, and 2nd-recension _dicta_ from Gratian's _Decretum_, there are 615 occurrences of 74 unique words ending in -_que_. (This does not count 339 occurrences of the word '_que_'.) Of those, 393 are occurrences of 19 unique words from Schinke's 54-word pass list, while 222 occurrences of 55 unique words are not. It is from these 222 words that, according to Schinke, the -_que_ ending should be detached as an enclitic.

However, the 222 words include 64 occurrences of 16 unique words ending with the adverbial enclitics -_cumque_ or -_cunque_, from which the -_que_ ending should not be detached. The 222 words also includes a further 135 occurrences of 21 unique false positives:

+ cumque,
+ eque (aeque),
+ namque,
+ pleraque, plerique, plerisque, plerumque, (forms of plerusque)
+ quinque,
+ unamquamque, unaqueque, unicuique, uniuscuiusque, unumquemque, unusquisque, (forms of unusquisque)
+ usquequaque,
+ utramque, utraque, utrique, utrisque, utriusque, utrumque (forms of uterque)

This leaves only 23 occurrences of 18 unique words from which the -_que_ ending should actually be detached as an enclitic.

False positives overrepresent the frequency of occurrence of the '-_que_' enclitic as a conjunction by an order of magnitude. Including all false positives makes '_xque_' the 39th most frequent word in the sample, while excluding them makes it the 410th most frequent word. There are 47 occurrences of the word '_namque_', the most frequently occurring false positive, and the 202nd most frequent word in the sample when false positives are excluded. Detaching the '-_que_' ending from '_namque_' results in '_nam_' jumping from 509th most frequent word in the sample to being the 137th, while '_namque_' itself disappears altogether.
